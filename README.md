## Hi, I'm Madie! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an electrical and computer engineering student at Olin College of Engineering with a passion for data science and machine learning.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an HVAC fault detection ML model for Olin. We are currently in the data science stage, combing through 20 years of historical trend data for the system components to manually find and tag faults in the past.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply ML techniques to real-world applications through my fellowship with Break Through Tech @ MIT.
